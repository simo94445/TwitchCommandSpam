# TwitchCommandSpam
Run commands for a lot of users
<br />
Example, if you want to run the command /ban for a list of bots:
<br />
in the big textbox, type the names you want to run the command for like:
<br />
user1<br />
user2<br />
user3<br />
user4<br />
user5<br />
<br />
and in the command textbox, you can type something like:
<br />
/ban
<br />
You then click "Go!", the script will wait 5 seconds in which you have time to enter the chat for your stream, then it will start typing out the command for each user with a 1 second delay between each message.
