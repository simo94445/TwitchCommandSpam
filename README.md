Run commands for a lot of users

Example, if you want to run the command /ban for a list of bots:

in the big textbox, type the names you want to run the command for like:

user1
user2
user3
user4
user5

and in the command textbox, you can type something like:

/ban

You then click "Go!", the script will wait 5 seconds in which you have time to enter the chat for your stream, then it will start typing out the command for each user with a 1 second delay between each message.
